Homework 2

The integral that I have chosen for this assignment is the Gamma Function. 
This function shows up in a few places that apply to physics. The first case is the Gamma distribution, which can be used to model queue times or reliability modeling for electronic components. 
The truely physics applications of the Gamma function is it's use in defining the Beta function. The Beta function can be written by using three different Gamma functions. This function has been shown to describe many of the properties of the strong nuclear force. It has applications in string theory. Specifically, it can model the nuclear interactions of elementary particles as 1D strings rather than zero dimensional particles. 
There are many places where the Gamma function can be used and, therefore, is an integral part of a physics education.
