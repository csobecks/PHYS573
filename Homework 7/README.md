# Homework 7

The differential equation that I have chosen is the Korteweg-De Vries (KdV) Equation. This equation is a model for waves on a shallow surface of water. This can be extended to various lattice systems in condensed matter. Specifically, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice system is connected to this equation. One interesting thing about the KdV equation is that if the wave has a fixed form that maintains its shape as it travels at a constant phase speed, the partial differential equation becomes an ordinary third order differential equation. 
This is the case that I consider in my code, where the phase speed is the only parameter that needs tuning.
