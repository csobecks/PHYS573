## Homework 3

The special functions I have chosen are the spherical harmonics, Legendre polynomials, and the Associated Legendre Polynomials. I've chosen these three because I wanted to do the spherical harmonics, but that requires the other two polynomials. The spherical harmonics arise in a number of places in quantum mechanics and electromagnetism. One specific example of their use is when calculating the wave function for the Hydrogen atom.
